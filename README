Terrain

An implementation of view independent progressive mesh terrain.
To see it, run 

	Terrain/Terrain.exe [size_in_patches]

size_in_patches is the number of patches (1 patch = 64 meters) you want your terrain
to have in each dimension. Default is 16, which equals 1km x 1km terrain chunk.

For navigation use W, S, A, D, R, F, T, G, and right-click / drag mouse.
V toggles wireframe, K toggles terrain follow camera mode, X return the camera to 
the origin. Other random keys do random things.

New terrain generation takes some time to complete. It will start rendering pretty 
much immediately, but will need time to generate the progressive meshes. Each patch
is saved when it's optimized, so generation will only take place if you generate a 
terrain with a different size. The mesh generation progress is kindof obvious when 
you view the terrain in wireframe. Rendering will be slow until all terrain has 
been optimized.

For a not-very-serious explanation what the hell this is and how to make your own, 
you can check Terrain/VIPMTerrain.doc

I wrote this thing when I was bored between jobs. You're welcome to lift any part 
of it in case you think it might be useful to you in any way.
