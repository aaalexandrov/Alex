			Story</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Suppose you are making a computer game. Let's further suppose -
			just to be particular - that it's a game with hedgehogs. Or
			badgers. Yes, badgers are better.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Anyway, back to the game. Making games is easy. You just have to
			know what you want to do, see what prevents you from doing it, and
			fix the bugger. Do that long enough, and you've got your game
			ready to play.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Take, for example, this</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: The badgers (and the hedgehogs too) are falling
			down, infinitely tumbling into the void because your game is still
			empty and they have nothing to step on.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			There's the obvious</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Add some ground below their feet. Implement
			terrain for your game.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			See? I told you it was easy!</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Now, if you're making an RTS or something else with a view that
			only shows a small patch of the ground, your work is done and you
			can go drink beer at your game's launch party and tell solemn
			tales about how difficult developing that terrain was.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			If, however, you tried to peek towards the horizon (to take a
			picture of the hedgehogs framed against the setting sun) you
			likely realized you have a</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: Your game slows down to a crawl whenever you try
			to look at a sizeable portion of terrain. The further away you
			allow your terrain to be seen, the morer* your frame rate drops.
			(* morer = more x more, since the area of terrain you need to
			render grows with the square of your view distance). The more
			terrain that's visible, the more vertices and triangles on screen,
			and the more chunks of terrain need to be rendered on the same
			frame (you did remember to divide your terrain into chunks, didn't
			you?).</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Luckily, there's a well known</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Add level of detail (LOD) to the terrain.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Now, your run-of-the-mill quadtree LOD thing goes something like
			this &ndash; if your terrain is normally rendered with vertices
			that are 1 meter apart, you only do that with terrain that's right
			under your badger's nose. Terrain that's twice further away looks
			two times smaller, so in order to render it with the same size
			triangles on the screen as the closer terrain, you only need it to
			have vertices that are 2 meters apart instead of 1. And you can
			make the chunks with which you render to be 4 times more spacious
			(i.e. twice as wide and twice as long). If you keep increasing the
			vertex distance and the chunk size to 4, 8, 16, and 65636
			eventually as camera distance increases, suddenly you are able to
			render terrain indefinitely far, because the decrease of vertices,
			triangles and draw calls (or chunks, if you prefer) as terrain
			gets further away is just enough to compensate for the rendered
			area growth. More or less.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			This terrain's quite good. It's quick and relatively simple to
			write, and runs as fast as a badger with a fox on its tail. Before
			you head to the launch party, you only need to put food for the
			badgers and hedgehogs in the game. As it happens, badgers eat
			carrots, and hedgehogs like potatoes (let's not get technical
			here, remember - game design is an art form). So &ndash; brown
			soil for potatoes, and orange carrot fields and we're gone off to
			drink that beer.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			When you have different types of surface, you're likely going to
			render it with different materials on separate passes, each one
			consisting of the triangles that have a vertex with this
			particular surface type in them. This is called texture splatting
			and is commonly used to display terrain.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Funny thing though, again a</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: Now that the carrots and potatoes are in, suddenly
			the moment when terrain geometry switches its LOD level becomes
			quite noticeable. When vertices change their spacing from 1 to 2
			to 4 to 8 meters apart, the boundaries between the contrasting
			materials can't help but shift abruptly.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			This is because material information is contained in the vertices,
			and the successively more sparse vertices allow for coarser
			grained material areas. If for example the original surface
			changes from potatoes to carrots at the 6<SUP>th</SUP> meter, when
			you get up to 4 meters vertex resolution, you can only switch at
			the 4<SUP>th</SUP> or the 8<SUP>th</SUP> meter and the boundary
			will shift from its original position.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			That's not all that's wrong with the terrain though. Even if you
			were to take care not to put contrasting surfaces next to each
			other so that it does not show as much when mesh resolution
			switches, the moment of LOD level change is still noticeable. The
			human eye is particularly perceptive to edge movement and to
			changes in shade and color of large areas. Carrots next to
			potatoes is just one kind of edge that changes position when LOD
			switches, the other one is terrain outline. The edges between
			foreground and background terrain, or between terrain and sky will
			shift too and there's nothing you can do about it.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			If you are using vertices to encode surface normals, you'll get
			the other kind of noticeable change too, because the lighting will
			change across the whole area that just switched LOD.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			The third problematic aspect of using this LOD scheme is not
			directly perceivable, but real nonetheless. Uniform meshes are
			generally a wasteful way to represent a surface. A given level of
			detail of our terrain places a vertex for example every 4 meters
			without any regard if one's needed at that exact spot and not a
			meter to the left, or even if it can be skipped altogether because
			the surface there is flat as a badger's forehead.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Ship the game and go drink beer already. Just
			about every title out there seems to use a variation of this
			technique and nobody ever complained about it.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			As much as problems are in the eye of the beholder, and the
			typical beholder really seems not to mind most of the time, that's
			probably fine. But you won't do it, will you? Because things can
			get better. Also, because beer has the funny habit of tasting
			better if you really deserve it.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Better</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Move surface normal and surface type information
			out of the vertices and into textures. This will minimize surface
			edge popping and shading changes. It will not eliminate them
			however, because the geometry on which the surface materials and
			lighting are mapped will change and some parts of their projection
			on screen will move. Also, this method does nothing about outline
			popping and is even more wasteful in terms of resources, because
			now surface type and normal information are always used at full
			resolution instead at a pace of 2, 4, and 65536 meters. However,
			image quality will improve.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Do you deserve your beer aready?</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			No, because there's an even better 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Use a real LOD generation technique instead of
			just skipping vertices at regular intervals.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			So we want our LODs to:</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			a) encode effectively the original mesh, i.e. preserve mesh detail
			where it is needed and remove it from where it can be skipped</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			b) minimize geometry popping, which is best achieved if there are
			no sudden changes at all</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			c) preserve surface type information</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			d) run as fast as a badger with a fox at its tail.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			The above list yields a likely candidate, scoring 3 out of 4 right
			away &ndash; view independent progressive meshes (VIPM). A VIPM is
			progressive, meaning changes are gradual and controllably
			(un)noticeable. It preserves detail where it is needed most by
			removing it first from where it is needed the least. And it's fast
			because all computation work is done at preprocessing time.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			A quick refresher on VIPM &ndash; it takes a mesh and locates that
			edge which, if removed, will change the mesh the least. Then it
			collapses that edge by moving one of its vertices on top of the
			other, effectively removing both the edge, the moved vertex, and
			the triangles adjacent to the edge. And it keeps repeating the
			same step until it can't modify the mesh any more without breaking
			it, or until it exceeds a given threshold for the magnitude of the
			change caused by removing an edge.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			The output is a regular mesh with the vertices and triangles
			sorted with those collapsed first at the end, along with some data
			about which vertex is collapsed to what other vertex and with what
			error. Attaining a LOD with a desired error (or vertex count) is a
			matter of walking the triangles at the end of the index buffer in
			reverse order and collapsing them until we're reached the target
			error / vertex count.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			But now, we're left with a 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: VIPM does not preserve surface type information.
			In fact, it does with it the same thing that the fox does with the
			badger when it overtakes its tail.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			When you do splatting, you have a separate mesh for every material
			in the terrain chunk. These meshes share triangles where materials
			fade one into the other. If you just make a VIPM from each of the
			splatting meshes, you'll likely end up with them optimizing the
			border triangles in different order. The geometry at the borders
			however needs to coincide perfectly at every LOD, or you'll create
			visual artifacts that will make a hedgehog gnaw at its own back.
			Plus if you made separate VIPMs, they would need each to have
			differently sorted vertices, duplicating the vertex buffer and
			wasting a lot of memory.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			This hints at the</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Make a single VIPM and extract each material's
			LOD mesh from it.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			First, we need to give our VIPM generator a notion of material
			types, and make it respect certain rules about them. More
			specifically, when it considers an edge to evaluate how suitable
			it is to use as the next collapse, we make sure the following
			conditions are met:</P>
			<OL>
				<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
				It's not connecting vertices of different materials.</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
				We're not collapsing a vertex on the material boundary to one
				that's in the inner part of the material area.</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
				The interpolated material at the position of the vertex being
				removed has to remain the same before and after the collapse.</P>
			</OL>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			These rules make sure collapses will preserve the outline of
			boundaries between materials while still allowing vertices to be
			collapsed along the boundaries.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Now we have the ability to create a single VIPM that encodes all
			edge collapses in all material meshes. What's left to do is
			extract separate index buffers for the triangles of each
			material's progressive mesh, generate the subset of collapse data
			that concerns this material, and make them all use the same vertex
			buffer.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			A little care must be taken when setting LOD levels &ndash; the
			separate material meshes need to have matching sets of active and
			inactive vertices at all times. The simplest way to ensure this is
			to set the LOD level of every mesh as the lower (or upper, if you
			so prefer) bound of the desired error threshold. Meaning that if
			the mesh has collapses with errors of 0.05 and 0.06, and you
			request it to set itself to 0.054, it should always pick 0.05 no
			matter its previous state.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			And, we're ready, right? We now have a LOD algorithm that's better
			than our previous one in every respect, can we go drink the beer?</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Turns out &ndash; no, because now we have a new 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: Our terrain chunks do not stitch together smoothly
			any more. This is because the VIPMs of the separate chunks decide
			to collapse the common vertices on the chunk boundaries
			independently and typically at different times.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: I have two propositions, take a pick.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			One, the simple &ndash; mesh flanges. These are like skirts at the
			chunk edges that extend far enough below the surface to cover any
			hole that would appear as a the neighbouring chunk's boundary
			vertices collapse in a different order. They're quick to
			implement, but wasteful in terms of both added geometry and extra
			fill rate. The latter might be significant in case your terrain
			has a high typical curvature and / or amplitude. Such terrain can
			produce quite large gaps that need to be covered with equally
			large area flanges. This might be significant or not at all,
			depending what's the bottleneck in your game's renderer.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Two, the perfect &ndash; make triangle fans to connect vertices
			that are active in the neighbouring chunk to the ones the local
			VIPM has activated. In order to do that efficently, you need to
			track vertex collapses and keep an index of triangles that are
			active on the edges, so that you can replace those triangles with
			fans to add extra active edge vertices from the neighbouring
			chunks. This gives you perfectly matching edges at the cost of a
			little extra CPU time every time LOD changes collapse or
			uncollapse edge vertices. And possibly a white hair or two until
			you make the software that does the stitching handle all the
			special cases. This is the approach I went for.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Ideally you'd choose which approach you prefer depending on
			whether your game's performance is CPU or GPU bound. Or you can
			toss a coin.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Intermission</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Question</B>: How large should my terrain chunks be?</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Answer</B>: The larger they are, the more accurate mesh
			representation you will get for the same number of active
			vertices. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			On the other hand, the larger they are, the larger the introduced
			view-dependent error. These are View Independent PM, meaning they
			are optimized with an error metric based solely on the mesh
			properties. Minimizing that error across the entire mesh does not
			mean the visible error from the particular camera position is
			minimized too. The mesh will remove vertices nearer the camera
			(thus removing more prominent detail), even if there's another
			edge on the other side of the mesh with a slightly larger
			absolute, but least view-dependent error. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			The balance between the above tendencies seems to gravitate
			towards the number 64. Make your chunks 64 x 64 vertices.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			And now, another 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: Badgers and hedgehogs now only go out at night and
			refuse to leave their burrows by day. An inquiry shows the
			constantly changing vertex lighting under the sun makes them
			dizzy. As edges collapse and triangles disappear all over the mesh
			as its LOD changes, the interpolated normals across the touched
			area shift and the lighting changes abruptly and visibly.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Move the normals to a texture, no way around that
			at this point. Bilinear filtering looks nicer than interpolation
			across triangles anyway.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Now, if your game's bottleneck was vertex processing, you can go
			on to that party. You've got a nice continuous LOD terrain with
			better image quality for the same vertex count than anybody out
			there. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Chances are however at this point you realize you have yet another</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: When you look towards the horizon, your game slows
			to the pace of a badger that stepped on a hedgehog with all for
			paws. The terrain makes an ungodly amount of draw primitive calls,
			owing to the fact our fine LOD system does nothing to reduce their
			number below the visible chunk number times the number of
			materials per chunk.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: It was a badger who first made the observation
			that from a certain point on you can't really discern any features
			on the ground and everything in the distance seems like large
			blots of paint with the average color of potato dirt and carrots
			respectively. He missed the irony when the next Monday his burrow
			was demolished by a short-sighted construction worker in a steam
			roller.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Armed with his observation however, we can literally start drawing
			large blots of average surface color. Instead of making passes for
			each material, we start drawing chunks that are far enough from
			the camera in one fell swoop using a texture where each pixel
			corresponds to a vertex in the highest LOD mesh and is colored
			according to the surface type of the vertex. This saves a bunch of
			draw calls, since there are far more distant terrain chunks
			visible than there are close ones, and we just optimized their
			rendering. Of course, we need to make sure there's smooth
			transition between the area where we draw actual materials, and
			the blot zone. We can arrange that by making the actual materials
			fade to their average color when they reach a certain distance.
			This can be done either by a simple lerp() in the material shader,
			or through overwriting some of the smaller MIP levels of the
			material diffuse textures with their average color. The lerp()
			thing is simpler and not dependent on screen resolution though.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Now there's a catch here. In order to draw a terrain chunk with a
			single draw primitive call, we need to have a single mesh for the
			whole chunk, and we don't. The good news is we can make one
			easily. Remember how our VIPM generator started out by making a
			single VIPM for the chunk, and we then split it between materials?
			We'll take the whole VIPM too now, thank you very much! It uses
			the same vertex buffer as the others.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Since we're clever, at this point we realize that our VIPM
			contains extra detail to preserve the boundaries between
			materials, and we don't need those if we're not going to render
			materials separately. This can amount to quite a number of
			vertices too, depending how frequently our level designer changed
			surface types there. We can now continue running the VIPM
			optimization from the point it finished when we created the
			material meshes, only this time we will run it without any notion
			of materials whatsoever. This will optimize away the
			material-specific detail. Note however that we need to somehow
			compensate for the fact the error estimations of the newly
			generated collapses will be lower than the errors generated when
			materials were accounted for.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			If we're really clever, we'll realize we don't need to take the
			whole of it though. We only need to take the part that corresponds
			to LOD levels that are far enough for us to actually need to draw
			with blots. This is typically far enough away where the mesh is
			shrunk to only a few percent of its original size so it's not a
			big deal at all.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			If we're cleverer than really clever however, we might realize
			that the whole VIPM is useful on its own up to the highest LOD,
			for things like early Z passes, shadowmap rendering or partial
			G-buffer output in a deferred renderer. The possibilities are
			endless and it's up to you to decide if you will use any of them.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			At this point you're either already gone do drink the party beer
			without asking any more, or you're pulling at your beard, because
			there's this same</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: The terrain still makes too many draw calls,
			aargh!</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			If you stop to think about it though that's hardly a surprise,
			since the draw calls we now make are actually more than what our
			very first no-LOD terrain was doing. And it ran horribly, if you
			remember.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: You need to do some kind of hierarchical
			mumbo-jumbo to unite chunks together so you can compress several
			draw calls into one. Theoretically you can use a quad tree again,
			uniting the minimal LODs of neighbouring chunks, and optimizing
			them further into a single VIPM with larger maximum error to
			render them together. I would only do that if I'm dealing with
			really large terrain and huge view distance, since it's quite the
			hassle and will create problems we'll get to in a bit. Just hold
			out on that beer.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			I'd rather create a single hierarchical level above the chunks, a
			super-chunk that's composed of 4 x 4 normal chunks. It has static
			geometry, produced by stitching together the minimum permissible
			LOD of all its contained chunks. In case you chose to stitch
			chunks perfectly, you may be wondering how to stitch this static
			super-chunk to its neighbours. With a bit of trickery &ndash; you
			will generate the static geometry with the added vertices to
			stitch it to the minimum LOD geometry of all its neighbours, and
			will only allow the super-chunk to start rendering as one in case
			it is surrounded on all sides by other super-chunks or chunks that
			are already at minimum LOD. This will take care of the seams.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			One level of super-chunks reduces the required draw calls by a
			factor of 16, which means that (assuming a 64 x 64 meter chunk
			size) a whole square kilometer of terrain reduces down to 16 draw
			calls total, if they are all at super-patch LOD level. That's
			quite good, in case you were wondering.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			And now, finally, we have the best terrain in the world! Off you
			go, launch that game and drink the beer.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Well, no. There's this small</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: This terrain runs nice, if you have a gigabyte of
			RAM to dedicate to it alone. Just as the sheer number of chunks to
			draw is too great to draw separately, the same number multiplied
			by several hundred KB to a MB of data per chunk is cannibalizing
			your RAM like a hedgehog destroys potatoes.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Streaming. For most of the map, only keep a
			static variant of its minimum LOD geometry that you can use to
			generate its super-chunk mesh with, or can draw with as a fallback
			while VIPM geometry streams in and gets prepared. Start streaming
			in VIPMs for all chunks that aren't united in super-chunks, and
			forget the VIPM meshes for all that are.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Which, sadly, is far easier said than done, because, as I am sure
			you are used to by now, there is a</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">

			<B>Solution</B>: Don't store them raw then. Store the minimum

			VIPM is simply the encoding of the order of collapsed edges in the
			original mesh, so you only need to store that order and you're
			done. To save time on reconstruction, you can also save the order
			of removal of triangles. That's it, you're done.</P>

			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: Reconstruction is O(n) where n is the number of
			vertices, but still it is not instant. It visibly stalls the game
			when meshes are created, and that's more or less every 64 meters
			of distance the camera moves. Too often to ignore.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Reconstruct VIPMs in parallel. Run a worker
			thread or pack your mesh data to an SPU, and just go on with your
			game using low resolution fallback meshes where VIPMs are still
			streaming and reconstructing. With the appropriate distance to
			start fetching meshes, the target chunk will still need to use
			minimum LOD by the time its actual geometry arrives.</P>

			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Problem</B>: VIPM generation from scratch is painfully slow,
			like several tens of seconds per chunk. And as we noted many times
			already, chunks are too numerous in a map for us to care.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			<B>Solution</B>: Have an editing tool that uses classic quad tree
			LOD to edit the terrain, then preprocess it before using it
			in-game. Or, if you do not feel like creating a separate terrain
			renderer just for the tool, enhance the worker threads you already
			have to not only reconstruct VIPMs from collapse order data, but
			also generate that data when it's not available, building the VIPM
			from scratch. In the mean time, use full resolution geometry to
			render the chunk up close, and 4 meters between vertices for the
			minimum LOD mesh in the distance and when part of a super-chunk.
			Then swap with the real VIPM (and save it to disk) when it is
			available. The good thing is that along with a way to edit your
			levels, this enables you to have terrain deformation in-game. This
			works decently in practice, except for the initial LOD generation
			of a whole map, which can take upwards of an hour for a 2km x 2km
			area, leading to reduced framerates in the mean time.</P>
			<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">
			Speaking of saving data, there's one last thing that needs to be
			saved along with the collapse order reconstruction data, and that
			is the minimum LOD level static mesh for the chunk in its
			entirety. It is typically tiny, but you probably remember how we
			were going to use it as a fallback when no other mesh was
			available? Well, it has to come from somewhere if we are to use
			it, and that place is your map data directory.</P>
